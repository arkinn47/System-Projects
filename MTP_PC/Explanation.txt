The purpose of line_processor is to take lines of ascii characters and pass them through four thread, all accessing
and depositing characters to buffers after having modified the characters until they eventually
come out in the stdout. 
The use of mutex locks was necessary to coordinate the thread to precent race conditions. 
In addition, it should be possible to submit a "STOP" through stdin to terminate the program.
