The purpose of the following program is to access the files and directories of the filesystem on a computer.
The lt3.c file provides the functionality of the various functions to process the CLI inputs to access
different files and directories. The librtree.h header file enables main.c to access the lt3.c functions.

The edited version removes commented out code to enhance readability.

Functions used are listed below aree found in lt3.c with description and lines number.
