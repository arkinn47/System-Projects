# System-Projects

This respository is private and is meant to display projects involving systems level programming for the benefit of technical interviewers for the IBM Linux OS developer position in Waterford, Ireland.

Each project has brief explanation, talking about what the project generally does, and the MTP and Libtree projects have a layout of the main functions and line numbers to make navigating the long files easier.

The projects thus far are as follows:

1. Base64 encoder
   
2.  File Tree display

3.  Multi threaded Consumer-Producer Project

4.  Jenkinsfile for automated CI/CD pipeline for learn-jenkins-app
